# Completed this course! 🎉

Course has been completed, I have made notes on the ways to operate git and github.
I have previous experience with git & github but the more I use it the better I get.
I like to keep a git cheat sheet on my laptop so I have the resourses on hand when I need to use them. This ensures errors are prevented.
